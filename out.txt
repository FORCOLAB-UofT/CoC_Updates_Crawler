CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:# TensorFlow Code of Conduct
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:This Code of Conduct applies to all content on tensorflow.org, TensorFlow’s GitHub organization, or any other official TensorFlow web presence allowing for community interactions, as well as at all official TensorFlow events, whether offline or online.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:The Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing TensorFlow or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed or de facto representative at an online or offline event. 
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:Violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to TensorFlow’s Project Stewards, Thea Lamkin (thealamkin@google.com) and Joana Carrasqueira (joanafilipa@google.com). The Project Steward will determine whether the Code of Conduct was violated, and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces, or project forums. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:Violations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated to the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct that has occurred within one year of the report.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:If the Project Stewards receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project Stewards will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project Stewards will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project Stewards may issue sanctions without notice.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4, and includes some aspects of the Geek Feminism Code of Conduct and the Drupal Code of Conduct.
